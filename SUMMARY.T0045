<html><body> This Perl module makes the use of clearprompt(1) both
simpler and more portable between UNIX and Windows.  It handles UNIX/NT
quoting and path issues transparently, manages creation, reading, and
deletion of temp files in text/list/file modes, manages trigger series
prompting, allows capture of messages to dialog boxes and/or email, and
adds a clearprompt_dir() function to prompt for a directory.  Note: a
newer version may be present at
