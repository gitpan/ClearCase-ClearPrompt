The ClearPrompt module provides a wrapper around the clearprompt
ClearCase utility. It provides the following conveniences:

=> It handles Unix/NT quoting and pathing issues automatically.

=> It takes over the task of defining, creating, reading, and unlinking
temp files for those clearprompt modes which leave their output in a
file.

=> It supports use of clearprompt to fire off asynchronous dialog boxes.

=> It allows error messages to be automatically caught and directed to
dialog boxes when operating in GUI mode.

=> It optionally handles "trigger series" prompting.

=> It adds a directory chooser, which clearprompt per se is utterly
unable to do. This one simply uses opendir/readdir/closedir and the
clearprompt list chooser; it's kind of clunky but better than nothing
if you need to choose directories.

Most of the documentation for this module is in the standard POD
format so see the .pm file for further reading.  However, as with
many modules, the simplest introduction is to just download it and run
the installation through the "make test" step.  Once you've done
this, assuming it works ok, you'll have a pretty clear high-level
overview idea of what it does and the documentation can just fill in
gaps. And at that point if you decide to use it you're a simple "make
install" away; if not, just remove the directory.

As the POD also notes, you can crib some usage examples from the test
script.
