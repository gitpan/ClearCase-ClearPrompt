Most of the documentation for this module is in the standard POD
format.  So see the .pm file for further reading.

However, as with many modules, the simplest introduction is to just
download it and run the installation as far as the "make test" step.
Once you've done this, assuming it works ok, you'll have a pretty clear
high-level overview idea of what it does and the documentation can just
fill in gaps. And at that point if you decide to use it you're a simple
"make install" away; if not, just remove the directory.

As the POD also notes, you can crib some usage examples from the test
script.
