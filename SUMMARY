This Perl module makes use of clearprompt(1) both simpler and more
portable between UNIX/Windows.  It handles UNIX/NT quoting and path
issues transparently, manages creation, reading, and deletion of temp
files in text/list/file modes, and adds a clearprompt_dir() function to
prompt for a directory.
