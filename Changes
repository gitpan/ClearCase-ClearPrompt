Revision history for Perl extension ClearCase::ClearPrompt.

1.01  Fri May  7 13:32:33 EDT 1999
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.18
	  Split off from original ClearCase::Msg for style reasons.

1.08  Tue Nov  2 10:04:40 EST 1999
	- first version sent to cciug contrib site.

1.09  Tue Nov  9 11:05:16 EST 1999
	- added clearprompt_dir()

1.10  Wed Nov 10 22:05:34 EST 1999
	- taught clearprompt_dir() how to switch drive
	  letters on *&#$% Windows.

1.11  Fri Nov 12 13:31:44 EST 1999
	- Decoupled from ClearCase::Util for standalone release.

1.12  Fri Nov 12 15:41:44 EST 1999
	- Fixes to work on non-GUI mode.

1.13 Mon Apr 17 17:36:28 EDT 2000
	- Minor cleanup work. Modified test #2 to demo prompts with
	  embedded newlines.

1.15 Sun Jun 25 19:25:56 EDT 2000
	- Added verbosity option (undocumented).
	- Removed unneeded -prefer_gui code in clearprompt_dir.

1.17 Sat Feb 17 23:12:15 EST 2001
	- Added support for CLEARCASE_TRIGGER_SERIES.

1.18 Mon Feb 26 20:40:07 EST 2001
	- Added GUI diversion of error msgs to clearprompt.

1.20 Wed Feb 28 23:06:21 EST 2001
	- Converted warn override to %SIG hook. This may cause a
	  perl core dump on 5.004 built for Solaris but it's cleaner
	  and 5.004 is old anyway.

1.21 Wed Apr  4 22:15:47 EDT 2001
	- POD cleanup.

1.22 Sun Jul  8 10:11:55 EDT 2001
	- Returned support for :all tag for backwards compat

1.23 Sun Sep 30 07:42:14 EDT 2001
	- Partially backported to ccperl (5.001). I believe
	 my code is now 5.001-compatible per se, and the
	 basic clearprompt() stuff works fine. However, some
	 features (such as TriggerSeries which needs Data::Dumper)
	 may depend on other modules which are not present or
	 up to snuff in ccperl. In fact Data::Dumper itself
	 requires at least 5.004, so attempts to use TriggerSeries
	 will certainly fail with ccperl.

1.24 Mon Oct 22 23:23:28 EDT 2001
	- Suppressed a spurious warning on ccperl.
	- Added CLEARCASE_CLEARPROMPT_DEBUG_SHELL option for convenience
	  in debugging trigger environments.

1.25 Fri Dec 21 23:45:35 EST 2001
	- COMPATIBILITY ALERT:
	    - The capture-to-dialog and capture-to-email lists are now
	    discrete. This means that C<+WARN> will capture warnings to
	    a dialog box, while C<+WARN=joe> will send warnings to
	    joe but NOT to a dialog box.  To get both you must now
	    request both, e.g. C<+WARN +WARN=vobadm>. See POD for
	    more details. This is in response to a new feature in
	    CC 4.2.
	- Added use of the 'notify' program to send email as a
	  fallback in case Net::SMTP fails.
	- Added '+PROMPT' feature.
